**NOTE**: This version of rapture is no longer supported. I've written a new
Golang version which adds more features, integrates into more shells, and runs
much faster. Check it out at https://github.com/daveadams/go-rapture.

The remainder of the README and the code to Rapture itself can be found in the
commit history.
